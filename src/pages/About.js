            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a motivated, and quality driven person. I have an aptitude for learning and am passionate about design and problem solving.<br/>I gained a Level 2 qualification from a 3 week software develop course which lead me to become a full-stack developer and complete a Level 4 apprenticeship in software development.<br/>After completeing the apprenticeship I became a teacher where I taught front end development skills on a short 12 week bootcamp at Code Nation. As well as teaching I also worked on some projects for the company such as creating a website that holds an online version of the course, I helped create the companies website, and also helped develop the curriculum.<br/>I am inquisitive, have an attention to detail, and love creating things. This is why I was drawn to animation in my free time. I am self taught in 3D modeling, texturing, and animation all using the software Blender. This passion also led me to create some animations to be used in Code Nation which are on my works page.</p>
